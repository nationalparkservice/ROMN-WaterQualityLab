# Overview

This repository houses ROMN's code for processing and quality control of water chemistry lab deliverables from CCAL and Test America.

# Contents

**Archive**: contains preprocessing Python scripts that were used to prepare lab deliverables for a VBA routine in Access. 
Both the Python scripts and the VBA in Access have been superseded by the R code in this repository.

**Code**:

- CCAL_processing_template.Rmd: a template for creating the EQuIS Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) for CCAL data.
- TestAmerica_processing_template.Rmd: a template for creating the EQuIS Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) for Test America data.
- CCAL_compare_current_to_historical_EDDs.Rmd: a document comparing the CCAL EDDs generated by the current R-based workflow to those generated by the previous Visual Basic workflow.
- TestAmerica_compare_current_to_historical_EDDs.Rmd: a document comparing the Test America EDDs generated by the current R-based workflow to those generated by the previous Visual Basic workflow.
- format_edd.R: contains functions called by the scripts above for processing water quality lab data.
- test_edd.R: contains additional functions for comparing EDDs.

**Data**: blocked by `.gitignore`. See the setup instructions below.

**Tests**:

- test-data: a subfolder containing artificial data that was created specifically to test our quality control functions.
- test-qc.R: a script for verifying that the quality control in code/format_edd.R is working properly.

# Setup

Since we are not storing data on GitHub, you will need to set up the data directory on your local computer following these steps.

1. Create a folder called `data` in the root of your local repository.

2. Inside the `data` folder create a subfolder called `output`. 
You can leave this folder empty for now.
It will populate with files as you run the code in this repository.

3. Inside the `data` folder create a subfolder called `databases`.
In the `databases` folder, place a copy of this database from the Z drive: "Z:\MONITORING\Streams\Data\Tools\SEI_ROMN_WQLab_Processing_Template_20230628v2.accdb".
Some of the tables in this database are on SQL Server and may require additional setup depending on your permissions.
The tables on SQL Server that are used by the code in this repository are dbo_Site, dbo_SitesMetadata, dbo_CollectionEvent, and dbo_WaterSediment.

4. Copy and paste the `EDD_examples` folder from the Z drive into your `data` folder (so `EDD_examples` will be a subfolder within `data`).
You can find the `EDD_examples` folder here (we may need a more permanent location eventually): "Z:\Personnel\Liam Smith\water-quality-lab\EDD_examples".
The `EDD_examples` folder contains historical EQuIS deliverables that are used in CCAL_compare_current_to_historical_EDDs.Rmd and TestAmerica_compare_current_to_historical_EDDs.Rmd to compare the results of our historical and new CCAL data processing scripts. 
They are not necessary if you are only interested in processing new data.

5. Copy and paste the `raw` folder from the Z drive into your `data` folder (so `raw` will be a subfolder within `data`).
You can find the `raw` folder here (we may need a more permanent location eventually): "Z:\Personnel\Liam Smith\water-quality-lab\raw".
The `raw` folder contains CCAL and TestAmerica deliverables that allow the examples to run in the R Markdown scripts.
They are not necessary if you are only interested in processing new data.
The raw folder is also where you will put additional lab deliverables for processing as they become available.
