ROMN-WaterQualityLab Code Repository for Rocky Mountain Network Water Quality Lab data processing

Repository includes scripts for preprocessing flat file (e.g. csv or excel) data deliverables from the Test America and Oregon State University CCAL laboratories.

Scripts processes all deliverables in a defined directory to one complied file. An 'Expected Fields' spreadsheet defines the expected fields which are processed.
Logfiles define all the fields that where processed, as well as undefined fields, and expected fields that where not present (i.e. Commission and Omission fields).
